Make sure you use your wok spatula to scrape the bottom of the wok so the noodles don’t stick.",

Dipped in a mixture of shallots and oil, Gai Tod has an incredible light and fluffy batter without any of the grease that is common in western fast food fried chicken. Gai Tod is a Thai street food fusion classic.",
